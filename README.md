# OllieBoard

Anime desktop pets for macOS. The characters wander around your Desktop, sleep, play with each other, and kick and tidy your real Desktop icons. Every AI coding agent session you have running (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini…) also gets its own mascot that tells you when the agent is done or needs your approval.

The app lives in the menu bar (🐾) only; it has no Dock icon.

## Features

- **Anime characters, grouped by series in the menu:**
  - Kimetsu no Yaiba: Nezuko, Tanjiro, Zenitsu
  - One Piece: Luffy, Zoro, Nami
  - Attack on Titan: Eren, Mikasa, Levi
  - Jujutsu Kaisen: Yuji, Gojo, Megumi
  - Hunter x Hunter: Gon, Killua, Kurapika
  - Also Anya Forger (Spy x Family), Frieren (Sousou no Frieren), Hitori Gotoh (Bocchi the Rock!) and Rem (Re:Zero).
  - Cat Knight: a kitten in armor with a pink bow and a cream cape, who swears on her sword and charges behind a shield bigger than herself.

  Each has its own personality and two special moves from their story, for example Tanjiro's Water Breathing, Luffy's Gum-Gum Pistol, Levi cleaning up your Desktop, Gojo's Infinite Void freezing everyone nearby, and Kurapika's chains pulling icons back to him.
- **4 playful political caricatures:** Donald Trump (a big beautiful wall rising from the ground, the tariff board), Vladimir Putin (judo throw in a gi, bear ride), Xi Jinping (a parade of tanks rolling past, a Skynet robot that lasers your icons) and Kim Jong Un (applause with a crowd of tearful officials, a missile that bursts into fireworks). Pure meme humor, no real political messages.
- **Desktop interaction:** characters kick icons across the screen, or line them up in a neat grid in the top-right corner of the main screen.
- **Browser antics (opt-in):** characters tamper with the page you are looking at: a fake swelling copy over a button or link, a marker swipe, censor bar or scribble over text, a sticker on an image. Then the character panics, plays innocent and runs away (nothing is ever clicked). By default these are drawn over the page, leaving it untouched; with **Sửa trang thật (DOM)** switched on in the menu they edit the real page instead (inline styles that stay until you reload the page; never clicks or touches form fields or password pages), which needs "Allow JavaScript from Apple Events" in the browser (Chrome: View → Developer; Safari: Develop menu) and the Automation permission, and works with Chrome, Brave, Edge, Vivaldi, Arc and Safari. Works with Safari, Chrome, Arc, Firefox, Edge, Brave, Vivaldi, Opera and Zen. Off by default; switch it on in the menu.
- **Play room:** a room drawn on the Desktop, underneath your app windows. Characters placed in it stay on its floor and only play with each other. Pick its scenery: a cozy room, one scene per supported series (a wisteria night, the Thousand Sunny's deck, Wall Maria, Tokyo Jujutsu High, Whale Island), or the UN General Assembly hall for the politicians.
- **AI agent mascots:** running sessions of Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, OpenCode, Cursor Agent and Aider are detected automatically.
- **3 languages:** Vietnamese, English and Japanese, for both the menus and the characters' dialogue.

## Install

1. Download `OllieBoard-<version>.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/vfa-khuongdv/OllieBoard/releases/latest), open it and drag **OllieBoard** into **Applications**.
2. The app is only ad-hoc signed (not notarized), so on first launch right-click it → **Open** → **Open**.
   If macOS says the app is damaged:
   ```sh
   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/OllieBoard.app
   ```
3. Allow OllieBoard to control **Finder** when asked. This is what lets the characters move your Desktop icons.

Requirements: macOS 13 or later, Apple Silicon (releases are currently built for arm64 only).

## Usage

Everything is in the 🐾 menu in the menu bar. The menus follow the language picked under **Ngôn ngữ / Language / 言語** (Vietnamese by default); the Vietnamese labels are given below with their meaning.

| Menu item | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Nhân vật (Characters) | One submenu per series (plus Chính trị, politics); turn each character on or off. Only Nezuko is on by default. |
| Phòng chơi (Play room) | Show the room, pick its scenery (Phong cảnh), choose who is inside it, and move or resize it. |
| Nhân vật nghịch trình duyệt (Characters play with the browser) | Submenu: turn the browser antics on or off, and choose whether they edit the real page (DOM). Needs the Accessibility permission (System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility). |
| Ngôn ngữ / Language / 言語 | Change the dialogue language. |
| Nhân vật cho AI agent (Characters for AI agents) | Turn agent mascots on or off, pick which agents, install the Claude Code hook. |
| Kiểm tra cập nhật / ⬆️ Cập nhật lên bản … (Check for updates / Update to …) | See [Updates](#updates). |

Interacting with a character directly:

- **Click:** the character is happy. Clicking repeatedly (4 times within 3 seconds) annoys it, except Bocchi, who melts. Clicking a sleeping character wakes it up.
- **Drag and drop:** pick a character up and put it somewhere else.
- **Right-click:** opens the menu of that character's special moves.

Bocchi is shy and runs away from the mouse cursor.

### When icons don't move

- The menu shows **⚠️ Chưa điều khiển được Finder** (can't control Finder): choose **Mở cài đặt quyền Automation…** (open Automation settings) and enable Finder access for OllieBoard.
- The menu shows **⚠️ Desktop đang bật Sort By — icon bị khoá** (Sort By is on, icons are locked): choose **Tắt Sort By trên Desktop** (turn off Sort By), or turn it off yourself in Finder (View → Sort By → None).

## AI agent mascots

OllieBoard scans the process list every 2 seconds for `claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, `opencode`, `cursor-agent` and `aider` sessions. Each session gets a mascot labeled with the agent and project folder name (for example `Claude · OllieBoard`). A mascot only appears while its agent is working or waiting for you. When the agent finishes or needs approval, the mascot runs to your mouse cursor to tell you. Click it to jump to that session's terminal window.

By default an agent's state is guessed from its CPU usage. For Claude Code you can install hooks to get the exact state: menu → **Nhân vật cho AI agent** → **Cài hook trạng thái cho Claude Code…** (install the status hook for Claude Code). This will:

- create the script `~/Library/Application Support/OllieBoard/claude-hook.sh`;
- add hooks for `UserPromptSubmit`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `PermissionRequest`, `Notification` and `Stop` to `~/.claude/settings.json`. Your existing hooks are kept, and the previous file is backed up as `settings.json.ollieboard-backup`.

The hooks only take effect for Claude Code sessions started after installing them.

## Updates

OllieBoard checks GitHub for a newer release when it starts and every 6 hours. When one is out, the 🐾 menu shows **⬆️ Cập nhật lên bản X** (Update to X): click it and the app downloads the new DMG, quits, replaces itself and opens again. You can also check by hand with **Kiểm tra cập nhật** (Check for updates).

- The update works when the app's folder is writable (the usual case for `/Applications` on an admin account). Otherwise the app says so and you install the new DMG by hand.
- Because releases are ad-hoc signed, macOS may ask for Finder access again after an update.
- Versions before this feature (1.0) can't update themselves; install the next release by hand once.

To publish a release the updater will pick up, build the DMG with the new version and attach it to a `vX.Y` release:

```sh
make dmg VERSION=1.1
gh release create v1.1 build/OllieBoard-1.1.dmg --title "OllieBoard 1.1"
```

## Build from source

Requirements: macOS 13+ and Xcode 15+ (or a Swift 5.9 toolchain).

```sh
make run
```

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `make app` | Regenerate the sprite sheets, build a release binary and wrap it as `build/OllieBoard.app`. |
| `make run` | `make app`, then open the app. |
| `make dmg` | `make app`, then package `build/OllieBoard-<VERSION>.dmg` (default `VERSION=1.1`). `VERSION` is also the app's version, which the updater compares with the latest release. |
| `make sprites` | Regenerate the sprite sheets only. |
| `make clean` | Remove build output. |

`make` calls `scripts/build-app.sh`, which you can also run directly.

The app is ad-hoc signed by default, so macOS asks for Finder access again after every rebuild. To keep the permission between builds, sign with a fixed certificate:

```sh
security find-identity -v -p codesigning   # list available certificates
SIGN_IDENTITY="Apple Development: ..." make app
```
